# advanced-programming-api

Python FastAPI project made for Advanced Programming class at university.
Features:
- primality testing for 64-bit unsigned integers
- image color inversion for JPEG images under 12 Mpix size
- JWT-guarded Unix timestamp retrieval

## Live instance
A live, deployed instance of the app, complete with an OpenAPI documentation UI, ~~is available at https://white-silence-4963.fly.dev/~~ is no longer available, as I have passed the course and have no further use for it.
